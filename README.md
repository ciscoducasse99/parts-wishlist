## Car Parts Wishlist

Small Angular app that let's me keep track of parts needed for my drift car. Made as an exercise to continue learning Angular's fundementals. 

### Todos:
- ~~Create fake server so CRUD operations can be used~~ | json-server is being used.
- Launch app using free hosting
- ~~Design basic UI~~
- ~~Implement services to load modal with child component & for server requests~~
- ~~~~
- ~~Use dynamic component to show modal and whatever component gets passed in~~ | <app-add-part-btn> & <app-part-listing> lazy load components into modal
- ~~Use @Input & @Output decorators to use service methods in child components~~ | 
- Write tests
- Implement routing | Not really needed, but doesn't hurt to learn.
- Implement auth
